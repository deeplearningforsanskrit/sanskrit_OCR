# Sanskrit OCR

Whats different in this ocr model wrt other devanagari ocr models? -> not much. I am just enabling some special characters that are generally seen in vedic sanskrit. For more information, visit [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_accent).


## Problem statement:

Given an image containing devanagari sanskrit (vedic or non-vedic) text , generate accurate text. 

Note: By default this model would be extensible to almost all languages which use devnagari script. 


## Data Generation

To generate random data, run 

```bash

python src/data_generation.py

```

This script will generate text files containing random sanskrit text and image containing that text.


## Model Training
